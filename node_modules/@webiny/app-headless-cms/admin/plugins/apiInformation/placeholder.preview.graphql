#  This is the API to use in your 3rd party apps to preview content.
#  It returns the latest content revision, regardless of whether it was published or not.
#
#  Note: to use the API outside of the playground, you will need to provide an API key via the Authorization header.
#
#  Example query - list content models:
{
  listContentModels {
    data {
      name
    }
  }
}
